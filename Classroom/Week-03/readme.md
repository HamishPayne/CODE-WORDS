# Week 03

## Electronic Literature
At the start of this class we started looking at what electronic literature was and what it could be.
We split into groups again and did a quick research session finding different examples of electronic literature that fit into a few different catagories (see table). Some of these things I wouldn't have concidered electronic literature before, I think my general idea of what electronic literatyre was was a piece of long form text that was displayed in a digital format, but now i beleive that it is a much broader catagory and can really be anything that uses letters, words or text, written or spoken, in any type of digital format.

Having a stronger understanding of the meaning of electronic literature made me think a bit more about what I could do for my main project. I want to try and do something different to just presenting the text in written form on the screen, I need to research the possibilities of Processing to try and figure out some ways I can present my text in a unique way.

## Processing
This week I kept experimenting with Processing outside of class. I was able to figure out how to make a shape bounce off the walls of the canvas and also make object appear and dissapear through clicking the mouse.
