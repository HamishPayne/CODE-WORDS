-Make sure it’s based around the text, that’s what the project was mainly bout.  
-Max 300 words, do roughly 200.   
-Don’t just waffle for the sake of it, be honest and speak about what you really did and thought. Don’t be superficial.

## Main Project
Andy’s Feedback: 2:00:00 PM ––– amazing aesthetic. dreamy reading space... and perfect font. digital utopia that explores digital materiality. loss of physical body (use of mic). take care of scrolling... what about floating the rock so that it returns into view...   

some questions i was asking myself this week  
*How can I make it smoother, whole numbers for the tint?  
How can I limit the mouse scroll?  
Would it be possible to have a different font each time? Random out of 10.  
Take advantage of the phase font.   
Do you think I’m leaving out too much from the text? Eugenics, body politics etc?  
How to make the words slowly scroll with mic input? Only moves really slow.   
How can I make the rocks slow/stop with mic input?  
I’m trying to think of a work around for using mouse scroll, it’s physical.*    
-Wrote out my 200 word reflection ready for the final submission
-SHOW PROGRESS.  
### 3D Text

SHOW RENDERING PROCESS

- Guy Debord’ss ‘the society of the spectacle’ which is referenced in my chosen text speaks about a “future society where all life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles, Everything that was directly lived has moved away into representation.“
- By creating the text in 3d the words become images. I thought about using icons or images instead of words.
- By turning these letters into 3d objects in space they become ‘physical’ representations of letters and words.
- I’ve Also been looking at a font which is made up completely of Nike ticks, I thought this would be an interesting take on ‘commodity fetishism’ that Debord speaks about, everything becomes a product. Even letters and language in this utopia has become a product.
- Now my code is almost finalised I’m starting to think about the design of the virtual space

- “There were no clues, there were no lyrics, there was no imagery it was just a feeling.”   
- “Design should become radically autonomous”.  
- Rudnick uses 99% fonts that he’s designed himself.   
- Talking about how fine dining institutes are an example of what design should be. A restaurant can’t exist on the internet, they must consider space, physically, smell, sound. These all have an effect on the final product of the restaurant experience.   
- What kind of narrative can you produce with something that only exists on the internet.   
- Chefs do research trips, experimentation with food, RnD. Chefs must be doing something expeptional and new to be successful at that level. Imagine if designers worked on that level. Everything we make is a revelation, and also meaningful.
