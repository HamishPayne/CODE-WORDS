## Main Project
Andy’s Feedback: 2:00:00 PM ––– amazing aesthetic. dreamy reading space... and perfect font. digital utopia that explores digital materiality. loss of physical body (use of mic). take care of scrolling... what about floating the rock so that it returns into view...   

some questions i was asking myself this week  
*How can I make it smoother, whole numbers for the tint?  
How can I limit the mouse scroll?  
Would it be possible to have a different font each time? Random out of 10.  
Take advantage of the phase font.   
Do you think I’m leaving out too much from the text? Eugenics, body politics etc?     
I’m trying to think of a work around for using mouse scroll, it’s physical.    
Originally I was going to use natural objects as I imagined in a digital utopia we would yearn for nature and the physical world, but I’m trying to do a bit more research to see how others have visualised it.*.
