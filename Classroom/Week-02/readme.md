this week we presented our initials that we designed and coded in processing.
It was really interesting to see how everyone had approached this, we all only had a very basic understanding of the program so were farily limited to what we had learnt in week one, this made it even more interesting to see what people had come up with using just basic shapes.
I found Processing fairly easy to understand as I had learnt HTML at the start of uni so I had a general idea of how coding worked, but i found p5js a lot easier than HTML, It just seemed to make more sense to me. After doing these HP experiments i'm really excited for the main project, I'm really keen to explore Processing further and see what's possible.

I've always enjoyed designing within a set of paramaters as it encourages me to think creatively so I think I'm really going to enjoy designing with code.

## Modular Typefaces

We also looked at modular typefaces this week.
I think modular typefaces and coding are very similar in the way that they both work within a set of limitations and follow a set of rules. A modular typeface must be made up from the same forms to concidered modular. I also like the way that most modular typefaces can by physically constructed and I imagine a lot of the time this is a part of the creative process of developing them as you could generate their physical forms and experiment with combinations to create the shapes.

*Some quick group research we did in class on modular typefaces and their designers*

The designer that I presented during our research session was [Benoit Bodhuin](https://www.instagram.com/benoitbodhuin/?hl=en), a type designer from France.
He is a designer I found a few months ago and really like his typefaces and design work, I chose to show his work in this exersice as some of his typefaces are modular (see below).

I like these two modular typefaces as it's not immediately obvious that they are modular. I was more intersted in the examples people showed of modular typefaces that took me a minute to work out how they were modular and what forms were being repeated.

## Re-Readings

At the end of the day we figured out our groups for the re-readings assignment and chose the games we wanted to use. Originally I was keen on using Minecraft but it turned out a lot of other people were too, so in the end my group chose [Club Penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin). At first I was a bit dissapointed that I wasn't going to be able to play Minecraft, but after signing up and exploring the CP world I was again interested to see what sort of results we could come up with within the limitations of the game.
