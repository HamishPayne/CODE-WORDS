In the age of new eugenic consciousness, physical bodies are cumbersome: their opacity is opposed to the transparence of the digital utopia that promotes a distance from experienced reality and a uniform space and time. The body and physical experiences are disruptive, because physical functions are both unpredictable and difficult to quantify. Within the digital economy, desire is given a privileged place, because it can be rerouted into consumerism. Body politics, then need to be orchestrated within this frame of organised consumption and fabrication: fit bodies, perfect health, eugenic ideology and neo-natal procedures organise the comprehension and use of the body within specific parameters.
