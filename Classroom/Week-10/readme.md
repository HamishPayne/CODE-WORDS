# Week 10

## CLASSROOM
- Google Noto Fonts.  
- Font Forge.  
- Andy reminded us of the list of examples made by Karen that were available to us. Reminded us we must reference any code we use or borrow from others.

## MAIN PROJECT

### Inspiration

Insane pixel garden website
http://www.pointcloud.garden/

Using a 3d object in p5js (face model with text running over)

3D text in P5JS, camera movable with mouse. 3D space.

### THREE DIMENSIONAL

SHOW RENDERING PROCESS

- Guy Debord’ss ‘the society of the spectacle’ which is referenced in my chosen text speaks about a “future society where all life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles, Everything that was directly lived has moved away into representation.“
- By creating the text in 3d the words become images. I thought about using icons or images instead of words.
- By turning these letters into 3d objects in space they become ‘physical’ representations of letters and words.
- I’ve Also been looking at a font which is made up completely of Nike ticks, I thought this would be an interesting take on ‘commodity fetishism’ that Debord speaks about, everything becomes a product. Even letters and language in this utopia has become a product.
- Now my code is almost finalised I’m starting to think about the design of the virtual space

### notes

- Show the final layer as a utopia
- ‘Distance from experienced reality’
- The layered images go from physical space to digital space
- Try and use 3d (cinema4d) to show physical text (physical materials) existing in a digital space
- Could have multiple images that display randomly each time you refresh, each time it’s a different experience
- What represents the physical? What represents the Digital?

- Show some of the inspo from notes. Only the stuff that's relevent    
- Andy reminded us that this was a typography class and that we should be focusing on the typographic aspect of this project so i looked really hard for a typeface that would fit the themes of the text. PHASE
- Show my 'notes for my project'   
- 3D text (look at notes for why)
- Speak aobut the physicallity of the images (rock, 3d text and it's natural texture)
- SHOW CODE (go back and add in code for prev weeks)
