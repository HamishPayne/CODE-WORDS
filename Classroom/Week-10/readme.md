- Show the final layer as a utopia
- ‘Distance from experienced reality’
- The layered images go from physical space to digital space
- Try and use 3d (cinema4d) to show physical text (physical materials) existing in a digital space
- Could have multiple images that display randomly each time you refresh, each time it’s a different experience
- What represents the physical? What represents the Digital?

- Show some of the inspo from notes. Only the stuff that's relevent    
- Andy reminded us that this was a typography class and that we should be focusing on the typographic aspect of this project so i looked really hard for a typeface that would fit the themes of the text. PHASE
- Show my 'notes for my project'   
- 3D text (look at notes for why)
- Speak aobut the physicallity of the images (rock, 3d text and it's natural texture)
- SHOW CODE (go back and add in code for prev weeks)
