[My main project so far](https://hamishpayne.github.io/CODE-WORDS/Classroom/Week-09/text_reacts_to_mic).

[Laggy Blur](https://hamishpayne.github.io/CODE-WORDS/Classroom/Week-09/text_blur).

[This](https://p5js.org/learn/interactivity.html) is a great example that shows a grey square gradually changing colours each time it is clicked. I want to use something like this to communicate the idea of the physical body being interuptive. If the use presses any key on the keyboard or mouse the sketch will slowly start to dissapear or become disrupted in some way.
