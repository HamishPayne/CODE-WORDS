# Week 09 (Missed Class)

## MAJOR PROJECT
This week I didn't manage to get to class on Thursday so I just continued working on my project.
I started to experiment with using a blur filter which would be controlled by the mic input to make the text readible through non-physical interaction, but I found that it would be extremely laggy and wasn't going to work the way I wanted to use it. As an alternative I tried filling the window with a colour that's opacity would lower with mic interaction, this seemed to work a lot smoother than the blur effect but wasn't quite as impressive on screen.

### 3D 
After seeing [Krtinine's project](https://kristinegudmundsen.github.io/CodeWords/SKO/Week_10/MajorProjectSketch05/) I was really inspried to try and incorperate different layers into the sketch to give it a 3D effect without actually designing it in a 3D space. I did some further research online and found a few different examples of this layering scroll effect which I want to try and use in my project.

[My main project so far](https://hamishpayne.github.io/CODE-WORDS/Classroom/Week-09/text_reacts_to_mic).
-Talk about main project so far. Ideas, problems etc.

[This](https://p5js.org/learn/interactivity.html) is a great example that shows a grey square gradually changing colours each time it is clicked. I want to use something like this to communicate the idea of the physical body being interuptive. If the user presses any key on the keyboard or mouse the sketch will slowly start to dissapear or become disrupted in some way.
