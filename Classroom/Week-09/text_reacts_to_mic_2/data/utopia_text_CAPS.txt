IN THE AGE OF NEW EUGENIC CONSCIOUSNESS, PHYSICAL BODIES ARE CUMBERSOME: THEIR OPACITY IS OPPOSED TO THE TRANSPARENCE OF THE DIGITAL UTOPIA THAT PROMOTES A DISTANCE FROM EXPERIENCED REALITY AND A UNIFORM SPACE AND TIME. THE BODY AND PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES ARE DISRUPTIVE, BECAUSE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS ARE BOTH UNPREDICTABLE AND DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY. WITHIN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, DESIRE IS GIVEN A PRIVILEGED PLACE, BECAUSE IT CAN BE REROUTED INTO CONSUMERISM. BODY POLITICS, THEN NEED TO BE ORCHESTRATED WITHIN THIS FRAME OF ORGANISED CONSUMPTION AND FABRICATION: FIT BODIES, PERFECT HEALTH, EUGENIC IDEOLOGY AND NEO-NATAL PROCEDURES ORGANISE THE COMPREHENSION AND USE OF THE BODY WITHIN SPECIFIC PARAMETERS.
