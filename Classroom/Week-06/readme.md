# Week 06

## Paper Prototypes
This week we started off byt looking at paper prototypes. The main idea was that using paper to physically prototype a project it can help in communicating your ideas to someone else. If you just tell some your idea it can be a lot harder for them to actually picture it. We were tasked with creating paper prototypes for old video games, recreating the mechanics of the game using paper, as if you were going to show/explain it to someone who had never seen it before.

My group chose the old mobile phone game [Snake](https://www.google.com/search?q=Snake+game+mobile+phone&rlz=1C5CHFA_enAU851AU851&sxsrf=ALeKk03md9sSEIoSHLgE4zUOIIgTSUVCZw:1601192988852&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIr8Ta7IjsAhU4wjgGHYnWAnYQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1465&bih=1135), this was a fairly easy task as the game mechanics are quite simple. Most of us had the same idea of showing the snakes as a series of single squares of paper that would join together to form a line which could then turn at 90 degree angles. Bridie had a great idea of using longer strips of paper which had been cut not all the way across which created a type of hinge which would allow her to show the idea of the snake turning while keeping the piece of paper intact.
