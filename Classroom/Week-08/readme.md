Karen spoke about checkpoints in a project, reaching each checkpoint in the stages of a project and working through it stage by stage. It's better than just seeing the end as the only checkpoint and it also gives you a fallback in case you are struggling to complete something you can just revert back to your last checkpoint. Karen also mentioned that we are not archers, we are not aiming to shoot our arrow and hit the bullseye, meaning there is not 1 specific goal we should be aiming for but instead be open to what we discover during the process and adjust our final goal as we work (I think that's what she meant).

## PROCESSING
-Karen tought us about classes
-We made the wiggly letters sketch

## MAJOR PROJECT

  -One of the ideas from my text is the way that physical bodies become disruptive in the digital space, so I wanted to try and represent this through using audio as the only form of interaction.
