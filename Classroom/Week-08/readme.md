## Paper Prototypes
This week we all shared our paper prototypes for the main project. It was awesome to see everyones ideas and the different ways people had approached making paper prototypes.

[Everyone's paper prototypes and psuedocode](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dX_ZDAdoo_U-JSXTtUxhwClVBWJZjEu7X48fx6t4-Zc/edit#slide=id.g980079f83c_14_0)

Karen spoke about checkpoints in a project, reaching each checkpoint in the stages of a project and working through it like that. Better than just seeing the end as the only checkpoint. Also mentioned that we are not archers, we are not aiming to shoot our arrow and hit the bullseye.
