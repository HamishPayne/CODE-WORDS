Final website with our projects
http://digbeyond.com/codeWords/list.php

CLASS
- Filled out the form and submitted
- Made gifs (This was hard lol)
- Presented our work (fairly brief)
- Karen got the site up and running, she did this insanely quickly.
- Final goodbyes :'(
- Taj has a really nice way of laying out his SKO, use the 'next, previous' buttons he's got.
  This doesn't have to all be in web view, just have a web page that is a landing page with a contents etc, the rest can be GIT folders.
