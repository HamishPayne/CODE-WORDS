### Reflection

- Creative Coding.  
- Teaching style (Checking progress throughout sem not just at the final sub).  
- Online learning.  
- Nice way to end my degree.  
- Reminded that 'the industry' isn't the only career path.   
- Continute to play with coding in the future.  
- My thoughts about technology at the beginning of the semester vs the end
