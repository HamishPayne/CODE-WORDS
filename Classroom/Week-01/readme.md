The first week concisted of Andy and Karen introducing the studio to us and running us through the different assignments.  
It was really cool to see the multi-screen Collaberative Ultra setup they had made, I think in a way this was an introduction to the kind of work we would be doing in this studio.

## Minecraft Melbourne

After the introductions the whole class met inside of Minecraft in a server that was designed to replicate Melbourne's CBD.
This was quite a strange experience for me, having a classroom run inside of a video game really got me thinking about the future of teaching and the formats and platforms for online education. The idea of humans living completely online scares me. I can't help but think of the Bruce Willis movie [Surrogates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogates).

## Machinima

Next we were introduced to the first assignment, Re-readings. 
Andy and Karen showed us the book [House of Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) which the first assignment would be based around. 

**talk about first impressions of HOL**

We also looked at a few different examples of people using video games as storytelling or performance tools.

**talk about quake friends**
