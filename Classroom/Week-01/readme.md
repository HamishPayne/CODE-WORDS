# Week 01

## Introductions

The first week concisted of Andy and Karen introducing the studio to us and running us through the different assignments. 
It was really cool to see the multi-screen Collaberative Ultra setup they had made, I think in a way this was an introduction to the kind of work we would be doing in this studio.

## Minecraft Melbourne

After the introductions the whole class met inside of Minecraft in a server that was designed to replicate Melbourne's CBD.
This was quite a strange experience for me, having a classroom run inside of a video game really got me thinking about the future of teaching and the formats and platforms for online education. The idea of humans living completely online scares me. I can't help but think of the Bruce Willis movie [Surrogates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogates).

## Machinima

This week we were introduced to the outline of the studio and first assignment. 
Andy and Karen introduced us to the book House of Leaves which our first assignment would be based around. They also showed us some examples of machinima which is what we'd be making for the assignment.
