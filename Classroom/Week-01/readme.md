# Week 01

I knew we were in for something different for this studio the minute i logged into the first Collaberate Ultra meeting. 

This week we were introduced to the outline of the studio and first assignment. 
Andy and Karen introduced us to the book House of Leaves which our first assignment would be based around. They also showed us some examples of machinima which is what we'd be making for the assignment
