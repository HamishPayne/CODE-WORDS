# Week 01

![](week_1_collab_screen.png)
The first week concisted of Andy and Karen introducing the studio to us and running us through the different assignments. It was really cool to see the multi-screen Collaberative Ultra setup they had made, I think in a way this was an introduction to the kind of work we would be doing in this studio.

This week we were introduced to the outline of the studio and first assignment. 
Andy and Karen introduced us to the book House of Leaves which our first assignment would be based around. They also showed us some examples of machinima which is what we'd be making for the assignment
