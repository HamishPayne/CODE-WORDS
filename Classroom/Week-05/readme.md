# Week 05

## Re-Readings
At the start of class this week each group presented to the class there performances for House of Leaves so far, we had one more week to finalise and respond to any feedback from this session. It was really cool to see what everyone had put together, I thought that the animal crossing group had done some really amazing work. I had always thought Animal Crossing would be fairly limiting in customisation, but the work they showed featured well thought out camera movement, location choices, character choice/customisations and just seemed to gel well together to create a coherent video. I think the cute aesthetic of the game made the horror narrative even creepier. 

It's interesting to see the application of something being used in a contrasting style to what it was originally intended for (reword this?).  
*How could I apply this idea to my main project?*

The respone to my groups [outcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxVLtIr6eNs&ab_channel=CeliaMance) was awesome! I honestly didn't exepct people to like it, but we got a really good response on what we made. Ferg's scene of the mineshaft was the standout. I think we did a good job of working with our limitations, using the different aspects of the game to our advantage like the minigames helped us to try and think about communicating the themes of the text in a more conceptual way as we were fairly limited with typing in the game. I think you have more of an opportunity to be creative when you have limitations.

## Major Project
We chose our texts which we would be using for the major project this week. I had checked out most of the texts that were offered and found majority of them quite difficult to unpack. I wanted to choose one that I was able to understand so that I'd be able to draw ideas from it with confidence. The text I chose was [Bodies and Digital Utopia by Catherin Bernard](http://digbeyond.com/readme/view.php?id=60&course=Code%20Words)
