# Week 05

## Re-Readings
At the start of class this week each group presented to the class there performances for House of Leaves so far, we had one more week to finalise and respond to any feedback from this session. It was really cool to see what everyone had put together, I thought that the animal crossing group had done some really amazing work. I had always thought Animal Crossing would be fairly limiting in customisation, but the work they showed featured well thought out camera movement, location choices, character choice/customisations and just seemed to gel well together to create a coherent video. I think the cute aesthetic of the game made the horror narrative even creepier. 

It's interesting to see the application of something being used in a contrasting style to what it was originally intended for (reword this?).\
*How could I apply this to my main project?*
