## Electronic Literature
At the start of this class we started looking at what electronic literature was and what it could be.
We split into groups again and did a quick research session finding different examples of electronic literature that fit into a few different catagories (see table below). Some of these things I wouldn't have concidered electronic literature before, I think my general idea of what electronic literatyre was was a piece of long form text that was displayed in a digital format, but now i beleive that it is a much broader catagory and can really be anything that uses letters, words or text, written or spoken, in any type of digital format.
