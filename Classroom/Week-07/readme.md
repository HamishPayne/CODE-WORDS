# Week 07

## Paper Prototypes
We started off the session this week by putting the chosen section of our text into [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqOlmfpCzXC9kA_vBeLOcTpdxCvWeo4zsiNa4uiDHTY/edit#gid=0). Then, in small groups, we presented our paper prototypes we had made during the week for our projects. It was really good to hear Celia and Win's ideas for their projects and see their paper prototypes. Showing them mine and speaking them through my idea helped me to get a better understanding of what I actually wanted to do, they also gave me some really helpful feedback. Win also showed me a few websites which he thought could help me with my idea.

[Whispering Galleries](https://www.whisperinggalleries.com/)\
*Whispering Galleries is an interactive artwork developed specifically for the city of New Haven by Brad Bouse and Amaranth Borsuk, the creators of Between Page and Screen, a book of augmented reality poems.*\
The design of Whiespering Galleries is very similar to what I want to do with my project, using type/transparency and audio input to effect text on the screen. I will try and do some further research into this project to see if i can find some motion visuals of it in action. The project explore themes of the intersection of phsycial and digital which is exactly what i'm looking at doing.
