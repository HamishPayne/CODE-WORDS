# SKO STATEMENT
This studio has been awesome and a really great way to finish my studies. I’ve really enjoyed learning the processes involved in creative coding and it has given me a different way of approaching my design work as a whole. Andy and Karen have been awesome teachers for this final semester, their approaches and views on design and education have been really important and eye opening for me. I aim to keep experimenting with creative coding in the future and see how I can integrate it into my practice.

Massive thanks to Andy and Karen for helping us all this semester, it’s been a really great experience and one I will never forget!
